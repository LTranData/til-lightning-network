The Lightning Network uses a gossip protocol for nodes to exchange information about the network, such as public channels, their status, and associated fees. This peer-to-peer data exchange allows nodes to build and maintain a current map of the network, which is crucial for them to independently calculate and discover payment routes. Nodes broadcast information about new channels and their features, and this information propagates throughout the network, ensuring a shared, up-to-date understanding of its topology for routing payments. 

- Information Sharing: Nodes use gossip messages to share information about existing channels and network participants. 
- Network Map: Through this continuous exchange, nodes build and maintain a comprehensive graph of the network, detailing channels, nodes, and their routing fees. 
- Pathfinding: This network map is essential for each node to independently find paths to route payments across the network. 
- Types of Messages: Gossip messages include:
    - Channel Announcement messages: Announce the creation of a new channel between two nodes, including signatures from both parties. 
    - Channel Update messages: Provide details about a channel, such as the fees a node charges for routing funds through it, making the channel operational for routing. 
    - Node Announcement messages: Communicate a node's IP address and the features it supports. 
- Organic Spread: Information about nodes and channels spreads organically through the network by nodes sharing lists of known peers with their neighbors. 
- Data Overhead: This continuous information exchange is a necessary data overhead, providing the foundation for reliable payment routing on the Lightning Network.
